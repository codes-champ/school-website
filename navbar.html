                                    My name is Maryjane Ibe. I started my schooling days in Blissful Heritage Academy from 2007 to 2013 and during my period I learnt so much from the pupils and teachers. The school offered good academics and lots of activities and parties with activities like Miss Blissful Heritage Academy pageant which I participated and won in 2011/2012. My favourite teachers were Mr Iyalla and Mrs Emecheta who have helped me in my academics, development and other progress. Other teachers not mentioned have also helped me and i want to thank the school management for all they have done and I pray that those that pass through this school shall not forget it and always remember what they have been taught.

                                    My contact with the school started in 2015 and since then it has been worthwhile experience in the following areas:Character Moulding: The school instills moral discipline which actually satisfies the yearning of my children. Academics:The school is blessed with quality teachers that impact the right type of knowledge to pupils no wonder, this is shown in the way pupils from Blissful Heritage Academy excels in other schools (secondary)and events they attend. Religion: The school is built on Gods foundation where clarity works is given in high priority and this is shown in the way the school takes care of the fees of the pupils who lost their parents. Summarily, the school gives compact academic package that competes favourably with standards in other places. Suffice to say that 'Blissful Heritage Academy school' is a model academic institution that is geared towards making the child a total being.
